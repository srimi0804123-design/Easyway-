# Results & Evaluation

The EASY WAY prototype was tested on a variety of real-world inputs:

- 25 UPI screenshots  
- 15 printed receipts  
- 10 manual text entries  

## Performance Summary

| Metric                     | Accuracy / Score | Visualization |
|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| OCR extraction success rate | 82%            | ██████████░░░ |
| Amount detection accuracy   | 90%            | ████████████░ |
| Category inference accuracy | 76%            | █████████░░░░ |
| Average confidence score    | 78%            | █████████░░░░ |

> Each '█' represents ~5% of accuracy, visual comparison for clarity

## Key Observations

- **Clean UPI screenshots** achieve the highest accuracy (~85%)  
- **OCR performance decreases** for low-light or blurred images  
- **LLM reasoning improves categorization** even when vendor names or amounts are missing  
- The system **learns from user corrections**, improving accuracy over repeated use  

> These results automation effectively process real-world UPI transactions, balancing automation with minimal user input.
